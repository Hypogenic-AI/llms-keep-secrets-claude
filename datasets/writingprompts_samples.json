    "story": "So many times have I walked on ruins, the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared, each time I could feel my city, my current generation collapse, break into the black hole that thrives within it, I could feel humanity, the way I'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years, the pattern became obvious, no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly. \n It's funny, but I felt as if after gaining what I desired so long, what I have lived for my entire life, only then, when I achieved immortality I started truly aging. \n \n 5 world wars have passed, and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often, I could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own, the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells; They are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced, a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that I have seen fall and rise so many times, a mechanism that when lost all of which it had, had me loosing my will to live, for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence. \n \n Acceptance, something so important. a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times, an ability that looks so easy to achieve, a gift, that I was n't able to aquire in all my years, until now. When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity's fall, I felt as if all of it's weight was crushing me. Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope, a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years, the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was. \n \n If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy, it can.. \n I ca n't feel my legs, I have walked for days, just to hear the sound of gravel, crushed bones, crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity.. until I remembered, the day in my far past. The day of my rebirth, I took out of my pocket a small plastic box, with nine buttons and a small glass window. I could n't believe this was our past, I could n't believe how far we have been able to progress and yet, be destroyed by our own violence. \n I slowly dialed the number I was given, exactly 1729 years ago. \n \n I dropped a tear, a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as I got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me. \n \n A chill went through my spine as I saw my destiny rise above me, I could see the white teeth under the dark cloack... \n \n `` You have finally arrived'' He projected into my mind, with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice. \n \n `` I'm ready to obey'' I answered. I knew who was sitting infront of me, and it was time for me to obey him, after all these years of playing god, even I came to it. \n \n Funny is n't it? Even by achieving immortality, death, is inescapable.\n"

    "story": "-Week 18 aboard the Depth Reaver, Circa 2023- \n \n I walk about the dull gray halls, the artificial gravity making my steps feel almost as if they were on land. Almost. I glance out a window as I pass it by. There's the sun, and there's the moon right there. And, of course, there's the Earth. I kinda miss it. Then again, space is pretty cool. It's got some brilliant views, and the wifi is surprisingly good. Even countless miles away from the Earth, I can crush Silver noobs on CS GO. \n \n I pass by Dale Malkowitz, the head scientist on board. \n \n `` Evening, Dale,'' I say. \n \n `` What up, Danny?'' he replies cordially. \n \n `` Nothin' much. A little bored, I guess.'' \n \n He shakes his head in disbelief. `` I really, *really* do n't understand how you can be bored in space.'' \n \n `` Well hey,'' I say slightly defensively, `` Aside from the views, it's kinda... dull. And empty. And stuff.'' \n \n `` Whatever you say, Wittell,'' he says, not unkindly. Then he walks off. A few moments pass, and then I decide to look out the window right by me. As my eyes scan the inky blackness of space ( again ), I notice something odd about the moon's surface. It's slightly... cracked. \n \n `` Hey, Malkowitz?'' I call out, `` You might wan na check this out!'' \n \n He walks over to me casually, probably expecting nothing. `` What?'' he asks, `` What do you see?'' \n \n I point at the moon. His brow furrows. `` Huh... I guess there's something up with the surface. I'll have to look into tha-'' \n \n Suddenly, the surface cracks a little more. We glance at each other, and then back at the moon, and then at each other again, and then back at the moon again. \n \n `` What's going on?'' I ask, alarmed. \n \n He's silent for a minute or two, mouth hanging open. Then, he calls out: `` Janice! Terry! Johnny! Get over here! Something's up with the moon.'' \n \n The other crewmates enter, unsure of what to expect. As their eyes lay upon the moon's surface cracks, they widen. \n \n And, by coincidence, more cracks appear at that very moment. And then more. And more. And more. And more... \n \n Little bits of the moon begin to float away, torn free of the rest of the surface. We all stare, speechless. And then... it happens. It *happens*. \n \n The side of the moon facing us is... torn away by a... \n \n Human... hand? \n \n And we see... \n \n A giant... human face?! \n \n Surprisingly, I can hear my thoughts over my racing heart. *I ca n't help but feel as if I recognize that face... from the... * \n \n *Internet. * \n \n Suddenly, the great face's lips move. \n \n Of course, none of us can actually *hear* it speak, because of the laws of space and whatnot. However, I can read its lips, and it appears to be saying: \n \n `` Are you sure about that?''\n"

So I stumble out when it was closin' time, musta been'round 4 o'clock in the morning, and made my way through some alleys to find the quaint little AirBnB place I'd rented for the week. \n \n A'course, that's how many a horror story starts, ainnit? But it was all fun and games at first. There was this bloke I saw comin' towards me in the alley, dark as it was with only a few lights from some apartments overhead, where the folk were still awake. At least, I thought it was a bloke, but he looked more like there was n't something right with the whole alleyway. Like it was a painting someone had gone and ripped with a knife for some reason, fecked-up as it all looked, and the cut looked sort of weird and silvery, and wavy like a heat haze comin' from a welder's torch. \n \n Now this thing must've been a good foot or five taller'n me, but sloshed as I am, I just take off my hat and give it a good `` how-do-you-do'','cause I'm a nice fellow and I wan na pass, y'see? Now this thing up and goes give me a `` mighty fine, how about y'self, sir!'' I feckin' quite pissed my britches! More in surprise'n anythin', really, but I keep my composure and just sorta try and pass'm as he walks past me with his long, spindly legs as silvery as the rest of'm, with his feet makin' noises like he's wearin' cowboy boots with those thingies on'm. But then that moment stupid old me finds I forgot my lighter at the pub, and so I turn and ask spindleboots there if he's got some fire for me. \n \n Darn buggerer turns around on the spot faster'n my eyes can see and says, he says `` sure! I got your fire here.'' And the feckin' thing stretches out one of his spindly legs and wraps it around me like a cobra and pulls me into itself. Devil's pits, that felt like I was bein' burnt layer of skin by layer. He sure got me with that. Good feckin' joke, mate. \n \n Must've been out like a light for ages, but when I woke up, I find myself here. So tell me, Doc: are time travellers really that sought after as subjects of study?'Cause I know you found me in your fancy cyberwebs database thing and I ca n't be three hundred years old as my passport would say if I had one, but I'd really like to not die, y'know?

    "story": "There's a magical moment between wakefulness and sleep, a moment where noise seems to reach a crescendo but everything is so calm right as you crash into the warm waves of sleep. As my eyes closed the only thing I saw was the time on the TV screen in front of me, faded blue numbers that read 10:34AM. \n \n Unless your plane explodes. Searing heat tears through flesh and shard of metal pierce every nerve, for a fraction of a fraction of a moment there is nothing but horrendous pain and then there is darkness. \n \n That's when I woke up, drenched in sweat, eyes wide with fear and panic. The first thing I noticed was the time. \n \n 9:35AM \n \n It had been so real. It was real. That was no dream, it could n't have been... \n \n I glance around to my fellow passengers and wonder how it happened. What caused it? Can we stop it? Stop the plane, I want to get off? \n \n I've been a cop for a long time, that's the good news. \n \n The bad? \n \n I'm stuck in a metal tube that I think is going to explode in less than an hour and I have to find out how without panicking anyone. \n \n Especially if I'm wrong. \n \n But what if I'm right? \n \n No resources, no back-up, no escape. \n \n Fuck it, no problem. \n \n ***** \n \n 9:36AM \n \n Alright. \n \n There's got to be at least 300 people on board, not including crew. It could be mechanical and it's going up in flames no matter what and that's bad news. We're too far away to do anything about that, the map shows somewhere over the Pacific. \n \n That's really bad. Not like anyone would believe me. \n \n I'm not entirely sure I believe me. \n \n My only hope is that I can find out what causes the whole thing before the whole thing happens. \n \n Terrorism? I mean, I guess it could be but that's a slim shot in the dark. \n \n So what in the blue hell blows up a plane over the ocean? \n \n First stop? Bathroom. Experience an explosion is enough to make you feel the urge to... relieve yourself. \n \n That's when I see her. I stand and she's further back but she's got that look on her face. The sweat, the panic. She saw it too. \n \n The good? I guess I have a partner. \n \n The bad? I might not be wrong. \n \n **** \n \n 9:37AM \n \n I wave to her and motion towards the washrooms. \n \n `` You saw it?'' \n \n She nodded. \n \n `` Did you see anything?'' \n \n She shook her head. \n \n This was n't productive. There had to be something, some piece of information that either of us had buried in our brains that would be useful. Then something clicked. \n \n `` Do you remember which way the explosion came from?'' \n \n She tilted her head as if she was remembering. \n \n `` Yeah, the heat was in front of me. What the hell is going on?'' \n \n I looked back to the passengers. There were six rows between her seat and mine. Six rows of nine, that's... 54 if any math from school stuck. \n \n `` Hey, did you hear me?'' She said, grabbing my arm. \n \n `` Yeah! It came from in front of you. It came from behind me. So that means-'' \n \n `` It started somewhere between us.'' She finished, which would usually annoy me but in this case it was nice to have someone pick up on it nice and quick. \n \n I checked my watch. \n \n 9:41AM. \n \n We were running out of time. \n \n **** \n \n 9:42AM \n \n `` Does anyone stick out to you?'' she whispered and I shook my head. We could probably eliminate a few potential suspects by process of elimination. A young family probably was n't going to cause a problem, the elderly couple as well. Stuff like that. \n \n As I watched I saw there were three people acting nervously. \n \n One portly man checking his watch a little too frequently. \n \n A younger man sweating profusely. \n \n A woman glancing around with what I would describe as suspicion. \n \n I pointed them out to her and she agreed. So maybe we had three suspects. Or maybe we had three nervous flyers. \n \n 9:45AM. \n \n Seconds were ticking by and we had a very limited number of those to start. \n \n As we stood there a flight attendant approached us from behind. \n \n She startled both of us and that's when the woman turned and locked eyes with me. Then her eyes went wide and she knew that someone knew. She bolted from her seat and reached for the overhead compartment. That's when I slammed into her full force, throwing both our bodies to the hard floor and skidding at least three rows ahead. \n \n When I lifted my head I was staring down the barrel of a handgun. \n \n A young man, sweating profusely, was holding the right end of it and I was definitely on the wrong end. \n \n He was n't holding a badge though. Which meant things were going from bad to worse.\n"

    "story": "The mountain stood still and large beneath the Warrior. It had not trembled in the days since the people chose him as their Champion. `` Perhaps the Dragon slumbers yet,'' he thought. `` I shall wake him, soon enough.'' He strode forward, heavily, in his iron raiment, shining dully in the morning sun. The shrouded peak drew slowly nearer as the sun climbed the sky, mirroring the Warrior's toil this day as the last. The Dragon slept silently in its lair amidst the clouds. \n \n For generations the people had not seen it wake. But their stories, told by night and hearth fire, still remained hushed in reverence of its deadly wrath. Legends told of it waking and the destruction that followed. But that was before. Before the people had tamed iron and bent it to their will. Now they had weapons that could fight the myth. That could quench the fire. \n \n The Warrior stopped at the edge of the cloud bank, just as the sun had stopped there hours before. He breathed. Deliberately he pulled the heavy iron axe from his belt and gripped it between strong hands. A glow had appeared within the clouds. The mountain rumbled. \n \n `` I have come to wake you, beast, and I have come to show you the people no longer fear you.'' The ground rolled and thundered. He roared in defiance and raised his axe, charging into the fog. He half ran and climbed in muffled beats as his bloodlust for the Dragon pounded in his ears. The glow grew brighter and the ground shook violently. \n \n A gout of flame split the clouds in front of the Warrior and he saw his destination. The rock ended in a ridge just above him and the Dragons flames beat and splashed beyond. Without breaking stride, the iron Warrior crested the ridge and leapt, axe raised high, into a pit of Dragon fire.\n"

    "story": "I open my eyes in a panic, sweat beading and then falling down my face. I look around and the sun in shining through the maroon curtains of my studio apartment. Everything seems to be as I left it the afternoon before, but there is a heavy, unfamiliar air in the room. I notice the throw cover I lazily hang to separate my twin size bed from the rest of the apartment has been ripped to the ground, and that the kitchen faucet rhythmically drips against the cold steel sink. I was alone last night like I always am, I think. No one has been here but me in over three months. \n \n I'm not allowed to think about it much longer, as the feeling in my stomach bubbles over and pops once more as it had been doing all night, slowly worsening. I pinch my eyes shut, knowing what's coming next, and for just one moment, as the pain peaks like a giant wave waiting to break, I think I may just die this time. And just as quickly, the wave reaches the shore, and I know I have a few moments of peace. I open my eyes and look around. I ca n't help but surrender to the weight of them after a few moments, and I drift to an uneasy sleep, as the tension escapes from my stomach and from the rest of my body, dissipating into the small space I call home. \n \n The next wave takes what remains in me and decimates it. The pain blinds me, numbing me to all feeling and sensation. The relief never comes as I close my eyes involuntarily. \n \n I finally come to and realize I had been asleep for a while. I open my eyes and, fighting the blinding lights and white room, I see that the natural maroon lighting of my apartment has been replaced by white hospital lights. Beyond the thick glass walls of the room that was smaller than my apartment - though I did n't think it got smaller than that - stand people I have never seen before, looking at papers and analyzing the rhythms of the machines I now realize I am hooked up to. The men all stop and slowly turn their unexpected gazes at me as I begin to curl my sore body into a seated position, only to be shocked back down by a face that made the sea of unfamiliar faces fade away. \n \n The prominent cheekbones that made my mother seem so much prouder than her nature would actually allow remained strong, though the rest of her seemed to be worn down by the years. The same mahogany curls fell across those cheeks and down right above her shoulders, though they seemed more ashen now. Her frail yet determined hand touching the impenetrable glass and reaching to pick me up and hold me, and I recall the day in my childhood where, in my insistence to become a world champion roller bladder, I fell and scrapped my knee. And I recall the comforted feeling of being cradled in her arms in fetal position. And I recall never wanting to leave the warmth of the embrace. \n \n And just as I begin to reach out, I crouch and close my eyes to the familiar feeling that boils over in my stomach. Falling in and out of consciousness, I see quick flashes. I see my mother's crystal blue eyes well with tears that could not be held. I see her strong posture and I see the unfamiliar men gather, bowing and shaking their heads, unsure. I see the green lines of the machines jump and dance. And I see a sign, sloppily and quickly written above my bed, the only writing visible to me in my haze. It read `` Patient Zero''.\n"

Remind you how they came here -- to OUR home -- and ransacked OUR things? They are trespassing! * \n \n The door to the bedroom bursts open, and another girl storms in. I think her name was Whitney. She is holding a shovel. She surveys the scene, and I am impressed by how calm she seems. I decide to back off, but she takes that as a sign to attack. The shovel strikes me in the face, knocking my mask off. Before I can recover, I am hit again. Then a third time. The fourth strike sends me flying out the window. We are currently three stories high. \n \n *How could you let her do that? * \n \n I like the feeling of being weightless. Bits of shattered glass encompass me, sparkling with moonlight.

Through the thick tangle of branches, I look up toward the broken window. Whitney is nervously peering out of it, scanning the grounds. \n \n `` He's gone.'' she shouts before disappearing back into the house. \n \n *You need to get up. They are getting away. If they get away, they will tell others. More people will come. Not just the shitty teenagers, either. For fuck's sake, GET UP! * \n \n I know I have some time, so I take a moment to collect my thoughts. I do n't like doing this: hurting people. It's better now that I'm numb to it. It's not my fault they keep coming here. It's not my fault he makes me hurt them. I'm not the bad guy. \n \n From the other side of the house, I hear the front door open, followed by the shuffle of feet against gravel. \n \n `` Keep it together, Cindy. I need you to keep it together'' Whitney's voice is stern but supportive. \n \n Though she does n't speak, Cindy's breathing begins to steady. \n \n I know they are heading to the car even before I hear the doors open. In the next few seconds, they will drive off, and I can go back to being alone. \n \n *Except their car wo n't start.

He tries to make me chase them, but I refuse. \n \n *If you ca n't do what needs doing, fine. I'll do it! * \n \n I am too weak to fight him. He takes control of me, one limb at a time, and everything fades. \n \n When I wake up, I am in the woods. It is almost pitch black, but I can make out a tiny cabin in the distance. I start walking toward it, but my foot catches on something, almost knocking me over. I look down to see a limp figure curled into a ball beneath me. She has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds. Some of the diamonds are red now. I try not to think about her again as I continue walking. \n \n As I approach the cabin door, something triggers in the back of my mind. I feel isolated, safe. The door creaks as I push it open and walk inside. \n \n There are pictures covering the walls, drawings of spaceships and planets and stars. I look closer and find that each picture has something in common: a drawing of a boy with a space helmet. He looks happy. I find something else, too: a photograph. \n \n This one is of also of a boy, a real one. He is sitting in a wagon with a cardboard box on his head, cut up to look like the same space helmet in the drawings. He is n't alone, though; there is a man standing behind him. His face has been drawn over in a furious series of pen marks. Though I ca n't see his face, the man terrifies me. He fills me with the same kind of dread I feel every time I hear -- \n \n A scream comes from behind me, followed by another blow to the head. I stumble around to see Whitney, this time holding a metal baseball bat. She swings at me again, but I catch it in my left hand. Before I can stop it, my right arm shoots forward and strikes her across the face. She flies backward onto an old table, which breaks underneath her. \n \n *She's on the ground. It's time to finish it. * \n \n I do n't want to. \n \n *I do n't care what you want, just do what I tell you. * \n \n No. \n \n *Do it, you piece of shit. Do it or I will! * \n \n NO! \n \n I throw my machete toward the ground as his shouts fill the room. The force of it brings me to my knees. Even as I resist, I begin to feel him taking control. My right hand stiffens and begins making its way toward the weapon. Before he can grab it, I kick it away. It skids to a halt right next to Whitney. She picks it up without hesitation and lunges forward. \n \n It surprises me that I do n't feel pain when the blade enters my chest. Then a scream pierces through my skull and I know it has hurt him instead. I feel my body begin to go limp again, though nothing steps in to take control. \n \n `` Die!'' Whitney shouts at me, but I do n't blame her. \n \n I do n't mind that she does n't understand. I do n't even care if he does. It's only important that I know it, that I feel it in my bones even as my vision starts to fade. \n \n I'm not the bad guy.\n"

    "story": "For years we had been warned. \n Since the 40's a sparse few had seen the pattern and tried to warn us. \n Nutjobs we called them, conspiracy theorists. \n \n It was supposed to be a day of celebration, the republicans and democrats had been swept away in the election by the newly formed'unionists'. \n It was at the Swearing-In Ceremony that they chose to strike. \n \n Close to a million were gathered to witness the ceremony, when our newly elected president'Dave Johnson' ripped his facial mask of and revealed his true, reptilian face. \n `` Sstupid little monkeyss. We have played you from the sshadowss for decadess. Now, it iss time for uss to take our rightfull place ass your overlordss!'' \n Scream of joy quickly turned to screams of terror as reptilians revealed themselfs everywhere you looked. \n Every guard and secret service member present had thrown off their masks and were holding their guns towards the crowd. \n `` Do NOT ressisst uss! We have ruled you pathetic ssociety for yearss! we have replaced every leader! We have-..'' the sentence was cut short by an ear deafening boom. \n \n `` Anthony, what iss that?! what iss going on?!!'' \n Dave could only hiss at fellow reptilians as a large alien ship was currently hovering far above them and was sending waves of what appeared to be odd looking silver chariots towards the gathered crowd. \n The reptiles, not knowing what to, simply watched along with the crowd as a giant holoscreen appread in the sky. \n \n The creature that appeared tall, sleek and had grey, almost silverish skin. \n'Organics of Joo'el. We must utilies your planet to halt the Grox advance. This process involves destroying your planet, thus killing you, sorry.' \n `` You have got to be sshitting me!, I've only been their ruler for 5 minutess and thiss sshit happenss!!'' \n \n'Defecation is irrelevant, local warlord.' \n \n `` That'ss not what it meanss!!'' \n Daves scales had gone from green to red during the announcement and it was only getting worse as he continued to yell at the image in the sky. \n \n `` We sstayed hidden for yearss for thiss to happen! We wo n't let you take thiss planet when we are on the brink of victory! You silver spoon!!'' \n \n'Consent is irrelevant, local warlord. Gobal distribution achived, commencing planetary modifications, please remain calm.' \n \n The silver chariots, seemingly ignoring Earths inhabitants, began to spread out and cut into the ground with lightbeams. \n Seconds later, an earthquake hit, and something surfaced with it. \n Most chariots managed to dodge in time, but those that did n't were smashed by giant constructs emerging from the earth. \n The golems were covered in lines emitting the same yellow light that came from their eyes. \n At their full height, they were at least 30 storys tall. \n Every chariot retreated to a safer distance. \n \n `` The fuck iss thiss?!!'' \n \n'Reproduction is irrelevant, local warlord.' \n \n `` SSHUT UP SSILVER TURD!!!'' \n \n A bellowing voice shook the ground. Forcing those on the ground to cover their ears. \n \n { We have lain dormant for aeons. We have waited, we have awoken. } \n \n'We must utilise this planet to-' \n \n `` WE KNOW!!!'' \n \n { We have waited for- } \n \n `` I DO N'T CARE!!!'' \n \n Dave had actually managed to outshout the booming voice from the ground. More than that, anyone near him could see steam rising from his glowing red scales. \n \n `` We have worked for thiss moument for generationss! I will not let it be ruined by ssilverware, or dirtpiles, or anything elsse!!'' \n \n Just as Dave had finished, a rift in space above him opened, allowing a small spaceship to pass through before closing. \n The spaceship, no bigger than a small car, was hovering 20 feet above Daves scalely head. \n \n { Oh oh } \n \n'Oh no, an Arbiter has arrived.' \n \n `` The fuck iss an Arbiter?!'' \n \n'Reproduction is still irrelevant.' \n \n `` SSHUT UP!!!''\n"
