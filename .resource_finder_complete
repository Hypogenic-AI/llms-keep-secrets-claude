Resource finding phase completed successfully.

Timestamp: 2026-01-04T17:50:00+00:00

Summary:
=========
Papers downloaded: 9
Datasets documented: 3 (1 with samples downloaded)
Repositories cloned: 2

Research Topic: LLMs are bad at keeping obvious secrets
Hypothesis: LLMs reveal/foreshadow information because planning and prose generation are entangled

Key Findings:
=============
1. No existing work directly studies "secret-keeping" in story generation
2. Plan-and-write approaches (hierarchical generation) improve coherence but may leak plan info
3. Suspense/uncertainty metrics from Wilmot & Keller (2020) can be adapted
4. WritingPrompts is the primary dataset for story generation research
5. doc-storygen-v2 provides a ready-to-use plan-and-write framework

Deliverables:
=============
- papers/: 9 PDFs with README
- datasets/: README with download instructions, sample data
- code/: 2 cloned repos (awesome-story-generation, doc-storygen-v2)
- literature_review.md: Comprehensive synthesis
- resources.md: Complete catalog with recommendations

Ready for experiment runner phase.
